# Template Project for HaxeFlixel games

## Debugging

To develop on the game, run `lime test html5`

### Template features:
- Pre-configured libraries
  - FMOD Studio project with menu sound effects and a random song I wrote
  - Ready to use Bitlytics tie-ins
    - - Grafana metrics visualization
  - Newgrounds API boiler plate
  - Various utility libraries
- Basic state templates
  - Main menu with buttons to load the credits or start the game
    - Controller, keyboard, or mouse support for menu navigation
  - Credits state with built-in scrolling
- Pre-configured .gitignore
- [Aseprite art pipeline](#aseprite)
- Github build actions
  - Dev builds on push to master
  - Production builds on releases

### Template Configuration (on repo creation)
1. Set the proper Github secrets:
    - `BUTLER_API_KEY`: The Butler API key from itch.io
    - `ANALYTICS_TOKEN`: The InfluxDB access token to the bucket
2. Run the `./bin/setup_repo.sh` script to update github workflow files and project configuration json

### User Configuration (new contributor setup)

1. `./bin/setup_hooks.sh` - Run to copy git hooks over
2. `./bin/init_deps.sh` - Run to get dependencies at the proper versions. See [haxelib.deps](#haxelibdeps) for more info.

### Metrics & Analytics
- Some basic analytics are already configured to be reported after the proper project configuration has been done.
- To view game metrics, run `./bin/view_metrics.sh` and a grafana instance will be created locally that connects to the cloud metrics. Graphs will be available at `http://localhost:3000` if the browser doesn't automatically open.
  - This script will prompt for a read token the first time it is run for access to the data. Consult whoever controls your cloud data for a token.
- Holding `D` and pressing `M` at the main menu will allow playing the release game without sending metrics. This is indicated by a sound effect and a log message once pressed.

### Dependencies

#### **haxelib.deps**

* `haxelib.deps` - Contains all dependencies needed by the project other than haxe itself
  * It supports two dep styles
    * standard haxelib dependencies
      * Formatted as: `<libName> <libVersion>`
    * git dependencies
      * Formatted as: `<libName> git <gitRepoLocation> <OPTIONAL: gitBranchOrTag>`
* `./bin/init_deps.sh` - Script that reads `haxelib.deps` file and configures `haxelib`
  * This script will need to be run any time the dependencies change
  * This script is run by the github actions as part of the build so local and github builds are equivalent

### Aseprite

All Aseprite files within the `art/` directory are automatically exported as Atlases as part of a pre-commit hook. The details of this process can be found in the `pre-commit` hook file, as well as the `AsepritePacker` tool code.

There is an accompanying set of code in the `source/loaders/` directory to aid with loading these files into game objects that allow frames and durations to be driven entirely via the Aseprite files.

### Maintenance

#### **Formatting**

* This projects uses the [haxe-formatter](https://github.com/HaxeCheckstyle/haxe-formatter) package for formatting using default settings
  * `./bin/format.sh` is a convenience script will perform the formatting
