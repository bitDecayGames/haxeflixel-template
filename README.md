# Template Project for HaxeFlixel games

### Template features:
- FMOD Studio project with menu sound effects and a random song I wrote
- Main menu with buttons to load the credits or start the game
- Credits state with built-in scrolling
- Preconfigured .gitignore

### Running the project
- If running in VSCode, the `settings.json` file already has debug run configurations for HTML5 and Windows
- If running from console, use the `-D dev_analytics` flag while in development prior to analytics being configured and ready for a prod build
